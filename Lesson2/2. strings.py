# Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.
mystring = 'hello'
print(mystring)
mystring = "hello"
print(mystring)

# The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes (whereas these would terminate the string if using single quotes)

mystring = "Don't worry about apostrophes"
print (mystring)
